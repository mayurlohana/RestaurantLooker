About:
This project is called RestaurantLooker. It gets you all the restaurants in the area by providing it with postal code in London. It will display Restaurant name, address, rating and what cuisines it offers. 
This project uses fetchrestaurants API which takes postcode as a param.

How to run this project:
If you have flask installed, all you need to do is start up the application using `python3 app.py` from the directory it is in. Otherwise you can run this application on your machine after installing flask using `pip install
flask`.

Improvements I would like to add on:
- More robust handling of errors
- Work on making it look more nice trying different styles ( which is exactly not my strength but I am working on it) 
- Better code management
- Better and optimized Pagination

**I plan to get this project more nice and decent this weekend most probably.**
